An open project to develop a newbie friendly repo for Hacktoberfest 2023 (next year)
This repo will be moved to an organization next year.
The objective is for me to learn how to maintain a repository and contribute to it as well BEFORE next year.
The repo will contain 100% free, safe, easy to deploy (to netifly, github pages, etc.) templates for simple landing pages.
Landing pages can be for a product, a resume, a company, etc.
They should use only HTML, CSS, JS and safe public includes (font awesome, material ui, bootstrap, etc.)
A list of safe and allowed libraries and includes will be compiled.
A key idea will be that it will be a repo that anyone who took Free Code Camp courses could contribute to easily.
Contributors can add a folder with a template or a theme for a template. Themes wouldn't change the template code. And all templates will need a theme folder.
More info as this develops. If you'd like to join in to be a major player in this endeavor, contact me on Twitter @omicreativedev
